# An Overview of a Love Affair (with Code) 


In my younger years, I built tumblr themes. I mean, 2009 tumblr. The period where you didn't have web responsive transformers, before the Palm Pixie, before the first Droid.
Before this, MySpace. That's quite a bit of time to pass.
Over the course of adolecence, I went from being astute in HTML and, later, CSS, to and adulthood of trying to move on without my friends in semicolon-suits.
I say this all with a wink, but I'm really quite serious.
Without having the beauty of syntax, my quality of life suffered.
Revisiting this old home is a bit of a challenge, as my memories mix with my disappointment.
Disappointment in having given up something which continues to make me happy


##In this checkpoint, I've rebuilt on an older foundation. One in which the world has grown in around very quickly, almost indistiguishable.
With so many more options, and so much more knowledge (margin, padding and border, in particular), it's easy to feel lost.

I've had to do a significant amount of research to get back into this game, and some parts I still have trouble with. In tables, I find that they can grow very complicated very quickly. Within the world we live in now, allowing room for (literal) growth, space, and smaller screens seems terribly difficult. For previous assignments, I've had to start from scratch twice, and others, thrice. I've spent a significant time looking for the smartest way to impliment all which would be necessary for a smart and chic transit application.##

Ensuring all of the data is legible, clear, clean and modern isn't a matter of adding as much #fff or #fafafa as one can imagine, it's a balance, one which will always be close to the heart.
